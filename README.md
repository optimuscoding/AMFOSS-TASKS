# AMFOSS-TASKS
SELF INTRO

Hello everyone
I'm Shruthik Binduraj,a first-year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering (CSE-AI).I love coding and want to learn a lot of new things after joining amfoss club.
INTROSPECTION

WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?

I've known to code for a while, and I've always liked solving problems. I always tried to learn new things and work on things that I am having trouble with. What drives me, even more, is the need to learn how something or anything works. I think amfoss will allow me to understand the world we live in today. I believe that I've got what it takes and I believe that taking me in will benefit amfoss.Learning is a part of life and learning new things should be our goal.

WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?

Becoming better at coding in general.I do many questions from codechef platform and when ever I am not able to solve a question I take time to understand the problem and trying applying my own logic rather than viewing the solution.. I want to explore all of those facets and I want to learn about them.

HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?

I will do my maximum and to the best of my abilities to aid and help the club and its members with anything. Even if it is just helping with some event or doing a project.
